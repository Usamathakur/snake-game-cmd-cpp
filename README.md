# snake-game-cmd-cpp

While making this I tried not to look at the source code provided by javidx9 on youtube but I had to as I wrote my switch statement my program started bugging then I found out about the problem was with my keyboard.

This game taught me how a player moves in a 2D spectrum. How C++ handles the linked list its real application is used in this game so whenever snake eats the food it will be a FIFO the element added will be incremented to the tail and tail follows the head in this logic.

Snake Game are simple yet powerful for a C++ developer as it will teach way too much about the language and the syntax. 

My Next Repository will be Noise Oscillation a small project. Then to my favorite CREATING A NES EMULATOR!!!

I am supper excited on that.

Thank You!
